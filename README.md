# Logging

This is a common swift library to log outputs while programs run. In the future this module will 
handle the storing and retrieving of logs and additional logging features will be added to log 
more information and more detail including the states of certain SDKs, device infomation and program
state. 

## Future features to add
    - Store logs to files so they can be retrieved in the future.
    - Provide a varadic or vardic like implentation to customise the format of the given log outputs
    - Set different log levels to separate the logs for debugging, information, warnings and errors
